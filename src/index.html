	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p1>
		Hello dear nice person who decided to click on this link despite it saying 'Not secure' in the top left corner.
		It's actually very secure and you shouldn't be afraid of your privacy being stolen or anything like that,
		the only thing you should be afraid of is that you will inevitably die and then the last person that
		remembers you will also die and you will be dead both physically and in other people's minds unless you
		write a book or something which would make people remember you longer but if you write a book
		just to be remembered that's kind of a self-centric thing to do but good thing is that none of it really matters
		because you can't do anything about dying apart from maybe inventing a cure
		but that's unlikely so just enjoy your life go cook something nice for yourself or
		if you're lucky for someone other than yourself and finally stop being miserable because
		it's not funny it's not cute it's not adorable also sorry for not using commas
		I thought it would make this text look less thought-through and more spontaneous which was a style
		I was going for because I thought it would quite nicely compliment the content of the text but now I see that
		it's actually pretty lame and unreadable for which I apologize but at the same time I already
		gave this intro way more effort than it deserved so all in all I'll finish
		this obscure structureless block of a sentence by saying that you are probably a very nice person
		and you are probably also a very smart person so keep it up oh and thanks for helping me I truly appreciate it know what im sayin?

		So anyway, you would help me a lot if I could use some audio data from you to train a learning algorithm
		to distinguish a couple of words. The data is going to be stored locally on my computer until I don't
		need it anymore and it's going to be used only for the purpose of training. Below you'll find a list of words,
		with an example audio sample attached, which demonstrates how you should pronounce the word.
		Each word example attached is the current 'most beatifully' pronounced sample of the word in the database,
		according to how symmetric and mathematically elegant its features are.
		So, if you make it to be the example, congrats, if not don't worry, this 'symmetry and mathematical elegancy'
		algorithm is pretty stupid (I mean, if you made the example, its very very precise!).
		So basically I'd like you to keep saying each word until you get bored of it. You can pronounce it in weird ways,
		as long as another human could understand the word. Please record in a somewhat quite environment (some small noise in the background is fine).
		If you accidentally pronounce a word wrong, or some noise disturbs the recording, please click the 'Erase last 5 seconds button'.
		What this button will do is it will erase the last 5 seconds. Please go in the order the words are listed, they are actually
		being dynamically ordered based on which words I currently need the most.
		You can quit at any time, thanks once again and happy recording.

		Last thing, while pronouncing the words, please make sure to leave a moment of silence between them for at least 20 milliseconds.
		To give you better picture of what 20 ms is, it's equivalent to the time it takes a train moving at the speed of 6m / 20ms to travel 6 meters,
		a falling star 10 light years away to move one bilionth of a centimeter on the evening sky or the limfjord bridge conductor to raise the bridge
		after he spots a ship somewhere in friggin sweden. Just leave some very short silence after each word please.
